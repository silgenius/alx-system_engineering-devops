# 0x1B. Web Stack Debugging #4

## Description

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on advanced web stack debugging techniques. The goal is to identify and fix issues that can occur within a web stack setup, particularly when dealing with production environments. The tasks simulate real-world scenarios where something is not functioning correctly within a web server, and the objective is to diagnose and resolve the problem.

Web stack debugging is a critical skill for any DevOps engineer or system administrator. It involves troubleshooting issues that may arise from the interaction between various components of a web stack, including the server, application code, database, and network configurations.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain proficiency in identifying and resolving issues within a web stack.
- Understand how to use various debugging tools and techniques to diagnose problems.
- Improve the stability and performance of web applications by ensuring the web stack is properly configured and running smoothly.
- Develop strategies to prevent common issues in a production environment.

## Project Tasks

### 0. Fix a MySQL Server Issue

- **Objective**: The web server's MySQL database isn't accessible. Investigate and resolve the issue so that the web server can connect to the MySQL database correctly.

### 1. Debugging a Faulty Web Server

- **Objective**: The web server is running but is not serving the expected content. Diagnose the problem, which could involve anything from incorrect file permissions to a misconfigured web server, and fix it.

### 2. Resolve Connection Timeout Issues

- **Objective**: Users are experiencing timeouts when trying to access the web server. Investigate the cause of the timeouts and apply the necessary fixes to ensure the server responds in a timely manner.

### 3. Identify and Fix Slow Query Performance

- **Objective**: The web application is running slow due to database queries. Optimize the queries or database configuration to improve performance.

### 4. Web Server Crash Recovery

- **Objective**: The web server is crashing periodically. Identify the root cause and implement a solution that prevents further crashes, ensuring stability and uptime.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/silgenius/0x1B-web_stack_debugging_4.git
    cd 0x1B-web_stack_debugging_4
    ```

2. **Review the Provided Scripts**:
    - Inspect the scripts and configurations provided to understand the current setup and identify potential issues.

3. **Start Debugging**:
    - Use tools like `strace`, `tcpdump`, and `gdb` to analyze the system's behavior.
    - Investigate logs (e.g., `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/mysql/error.log`) to identify error messages.
    - Test the web server using tools like `curl` and `netstat` to confirm its status.

4. **Apply Fixes**:
    - Modify configuration files or code to resolve identified issues.
    - Restart services as needed to apply changes and verify if the issue is resolved.

5. **Document Your Findings**:
    - Keep a record of the issues you found and the steps you took to fix them. This documentation is valuable for future reference.

## Examples

- **Checking MySQL Status**:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status mysql
    ```

- **Using strace for Debugging**:
    ```bash
    strace -p <PID>
    ```

- **Analyzing Web Server Logs**:
    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
    ```
