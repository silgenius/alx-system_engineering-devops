# 0x19. Postmortem

## Description

In this project, you will learn how to write a postmortem report, a crucial skill for any engineer working in production environments. A postmortem is a document that outlines the details of an incident or outage, its root cause, the steps taken to mitigate it, and the measures put in place to prevent it from happening again. Writing postmortem reports is an essential practice for improving the reliability and resilience of systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of postmortem reports in incident management.
- Learn how to document incidents effectively.
- Identify the root causes of incidents and propose preventive measures.
- Improve your ability to communicate technical issues to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Components of a Postmortem

A well-structured postmortem report typically includes the following sections:

1. **Incident Summary**: A brief overview of what happened, including the date, time, and duration of the incident.

2. **Timeline**: A detailed chronological account of events leading up to, during, and after the incident. This includes when the issue was first detected, the actions taken to mitigate it, and when the service was fully restored.

3. **Root Cause**: An analysis of the underlying causes of the incident. This section should explain not only the immediate cause but also any contributing factors.

4. **Resolution and Recovery**: A description of the steps taken to resolve the incident and restore services to normal operation.

5. **Corrective and Preventative Measures**: A list of actions that will be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. This could include code changes, process improvements, or additional monitoring.

6. **Impact**: An assessment of the impact of the incident on users and the business. This could include data loss, downtime, or loss of customer trust.

7. **Lessons Learned**: Reflections on what went well and what could have been done better during the incident response. This section is critical for continuous improvement.

8. **Action Items**: A list of specific, actionable tasks that need to be completed as a follow-up to the incident.

## How to Write a Postmortem

1. **Gather Information**: As soon as an incident occurs, start documenting key events and actions. Collaborate with your team to ensure that all relevant details are captured.

2. **Analyze the Incident**: After services are restored, take time to analyze what happened. Identify the root cause and consider all contributing factors.

3. **Draft the Report**: Use the standard postmortem format to draft your report. Be clear, concise, and objective in your descriptions. Focus on providing actionable insights rather than placing blame.

4. **Review and Revise**: Share the draft with your team for review. Incorporate their feedback and ensure that the report is thorough and accurate.

5. **Share the Postmortem**: Once finalized, share the postmortem with all relevant stakeholders, including technical teams, management, and possibly even customers, depending on the severity of the incident.

## Example

Below is a simplified example of what a postmortem might look like:

### Incident Summary

On August 1st, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM UTC, our web application experienced a complete outage due to a misconfigured database replication setting, resulting in data inconsistency and a temporary loss of service for all users.

### Timeline

- **09:50 AM**: A configuration change was deployed to the database replication settings.
- **10:00 AM**: The first signs of data inconsistency were detected.
- **10:15 AM**: The decision was made to roll back the configuration change.
- **10:30 AM**: Service was fully restored, but data inconsistencies remained.
- **11:00 AM**: Data integrity was fully restored by replaying database logs.
- **11:30 AM**: Incident resolved, and monitoring confirmed normal operation.

### Root Cause

The incident was caused by an incorrect replication setting that was applied during a routine configuration update. The setting caused a lag in data replication, leading to inconsistent reads across different database nodes.

### Resolution and Recovery

The issue was resolved by rolling back the configuration change and replaying the database logs to restore data integrity.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

- Implemented a stricter review process for configuration changes.
- Enhanced monitoring of replication lag to detect similar issues earlier.
- Scheduled training for the operations team on database configuration best practices.

### Impact

- **Downtime**: 1.5 hours of complete service outage.
- **Data Integrity**: Temporary data inconsistency affecting all users.
- **Business Impact**: Potential loss of customer trust and missed transactions.

### Lessons Learned

- Configuration changes need more rigorous testing before deployment.
- Enhanced monitoring would have detected the issue sooner, reducing downtime.

### Action Items

- [ ] Implement new configuration change review process.
- [ ] Set up replication lag monitoring.
- [ ] Conduct team training on database management.
