# 0x1A. Application Server

## Description

This project focuses on understanding and configuring application servers, which play a crucial role in deploying and running web applications. The project involves setting up a web application using an application server, such as Gunicorn, and ensuring that the application is available to users.

An application server is a server designed to install, operate, and host applications and associated services for end-users, IT services, and organizations. It serves as a bridge between the web server and the backend logic (such as databases) of an application, handling requests, executing code, and returning the appropriate output.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what an application server is and its role in the web application architecture.
- Learn how to deploy a web application using an application server.
- Configure the application server to serve web traffic.
- Ensure that the application server is running efficiently and handling traffic correctly.

## Project Tasks

### 0. Set Up Development with Gunicorn

- **Objective**: Set up a Flask web application to be served by Gunicorn. Ensure that the application runs and is accessible via the correct port.

### 1. Serve a Simple Web Page

- **Objective**: Configure the application server to serve a simple HTML page. This task involves setting up the server to handle web requests and return the correct page.

### 2. Add Routes to the Application

- **Objective**: Extend the application by adding more routes. These routes should respond to specific URLs with appropriate content.

### 3. Configure Gunicorn

- **Objective**: Fine-tune the Gunicorn configuration to optimize the performance of the application server. This includes setting the number of workers, the timeout settings, and other parameters.

### 4. Deploy on a Production Server

- **Objective**: Deploy the configured application server on a production environment. Ensure that the server is running continuously and can handle real-world web traffic.

### 5. Monitor and Optimize

- **Objective**: Implement monitoring to ensure that the application server is running efficiently. Optimize the server configuration to handle increased load or potential issues.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/silgenius/0x1A-application_server.git
    cd 0x1A-application_server
    ```

2. **Set Up the Application**:
    - Ensure you have Python and Gunicorn installed.
    - Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

3. **Start the Application Server**:
    - You can start the application using Gunicorn:
        ```bash
        gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app
        ```
    - This command will start the application server on port 5000, serving the web application.

4. **Access the Application**:
    - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

5. **Deploy on a Production Server**:
    - Follow the deployment guidelines to set up the application server on a production machine. Ensure that the server is properly configured and monitored.

## Examples

- **Basic Start**:
    ```bash
    gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myapp:app
    ```

- **Configuring Workers**:
    ```bash
    gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myapp:app
    ```

- **Setting Timeout**:
    ```bash
    gunicorn --timeout 120 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 myapp:app
    ```
