# 0x07. Networking Basics

## Description

Welcome to the 0x07. Networking Basics project repository! This repository contains resources, examples, and explanations related to networking basics. Understanding networking fundamentals is essential for anyone working with computers, servers, or network infrastructure. This project covers essential concepts such as OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, UDP and TCP protocols, TCP and UDP ports, and network host verification.

## List of Topics Covered

1. [0-OSI_model](./0-OSI_model) - Explanation and examples related to the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model.
2. [1-types_of_network](./1-types_of_network) - Information and examples about different types of networks, including LAN, WAN, and WLAN.
3. [2-MAC_and_IP_address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address) - Explanation and examples of MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses.
4. [3-UDP_and_TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP) - Information and examples about the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) protocols.
5. [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports) - Explanation and examples of TCP and UDP ports.
6. [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network) - Script to check if a host is on the network using ping and traceroute commands.
