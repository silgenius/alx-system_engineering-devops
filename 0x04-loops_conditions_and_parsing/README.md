# 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Description

Welcome to the 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing project repository! This repository contains a collection of scripts written in various programming languages focusing on loops, conditions, and parsing. The scripts are designed to demonstrate practical applications of loops and conditions, as well as techniques for parsing and manipulating data.

## List of Scripts

1. [0-RSA_public_key.pub](./0-RSA_public_key.pub) - A file containing a public RSA key.
2. [1-for_best_school](./1-for_best_school) - A Bash script that displays "School" 10 times using a `for` loop.
3. [2-while_best_school](./2-while_best_school) - A Bash script that displays "School" 10 times using a `while` loop.
4. [3-until_best_school](./3-until_best_school) - A Bash script that displays "School" 10 times using an `until` loop.
5. [4-if_9_say_hi](./4-if_9_say_hi) - A Bash script that displays "Hi" if the number 9 is stored in the variable `$TRUE_VAL`.
6. [5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance](./5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance) - A Bash script that loops from 1 to 10 and displays "bad luck" for the number 4 and "good luck" for the number 8.
7. [6-superstitious_numbers](./6-superstitious_numbers) - A Bash script that displays some information about the number 13 and loops from 1 to 10 displaying different messages for specific numbers.
8. [7-clock](./7-clock) - A Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes.
9. [8-for_ls](./8-for_ls) - A Bash script that displays the content of the current directory in list format using a `for` loop.
10. [9-to_file_or_not_to_file](./9-to_file_or_not_to_file) - A Bash script that provides information about the `holbertonschool` file.
11. [10-fizzbuzz](./10-fizzbuzz) - A Bash script that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, prints "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of five, prints "Buzz", and for multiples of both three and five, prints "FizzBuzz".

## How to Use

Each Bash script serves a specific purpose and can be executed directly in a Bash-compatible terminal environment. To use a script, follow these general steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Script Directory:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing the desired Bash script.

3. **Make the Script Executable (if necessary):** If the script file does not have executable permissions, use the `chmod +x script_name.sh` command to make it executable.

4. **Run the Script:** Execute the script by typing `./script_name.sh` in the terminal, replacing `script_name.sh` with the actual name of the script file.

5. **Follow the Script Instructions (if any):** Some scripts may prompt for user input or provide specific instructions. Follow these instructions as needed.

6. **Review Script Output:** After running the script, review the output displayed in the terminal to verify that the script executed as expected.

7. **Modify and Customize (if desired):** Feel free to modify and customize the scripts to suit your specific requirements. Bash scripting allows for flexibility and customization to automate various tasks effectively.
