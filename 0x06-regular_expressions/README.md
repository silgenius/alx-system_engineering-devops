# 0x06. Regular Expressions

## Description

Welcome to the 0x06. Regular Expressions project repository! This repository contains scripts and examples written in various programming languages to demonstrate the usage and application of regular expressions. Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing, widely used in programming, data extraction, and validation tasks.

## List of Scripts and Examples

1. [0-simply_match_holberton.rb](./0-simply_match_holberton.rb) - Ruby script that matches the word "school" exactly.
2. [1-repetition_token_0.rb](./1-repetition_token_0.rb) - Ruby script that matches a given repetition of the letter "t" in a string.
3. [2-repetition_token_1.rb](./2-repetition_token_1.rb) - Ruby script that matches a repetition of the letter "t" with specific constraints in a string.
4. [3-repetition_token_2.rb](./3-repetition_token_2.rb) - Ruby script that matches a repetition of the letter "t" with flexible constraints in a string.
5. [4-repetition_token_3.rb](./4-repetition_token_3.rb) - Ruby script that matches a repetition of the letter "t" with flexible constraints in a string, allowing zero repetitions.
6. [5-beginning_and_end.rb](./5-beginning_and_end.rb) - Ruby script that matches a string that starts with "h" and ends with "n", with any single character in between.
7. [6-phone_number.rb](./6-phone_number.rb) - Ruby script that matches a 10-digit phone number in a specific format.
8. [7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb](./7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb) - Ruby script that matches an uppercase word in a string.
9. [100-textme.rb](./100-textme.rb) - Ruby script that extracts sender, receiver, and flags information from a given log file using regular expressions.
10. [101-passed_linkedin_regex_challenge.jpg](./101-passed_linkedin_regex_challenge.jpg) - Screenshot of successfully completing the LinkedIn Regular Expression Challenge.

## How to Use

Each script serves a specific purpose and can be executed using the respective programming language's interpreter. To use a script, simply navigate to its directory and run it using the appropriate command for the corresponding programming language.
