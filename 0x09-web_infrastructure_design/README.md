# 0x09. Web Infrastructure Design

## Description

Welcome to the 0x09. Web Infrastructure Design project repository! This project focuses on understanding, designing, and explaining web infrastructure. It aims to provide insights into the components that make up web infrastructure, including servers, load balancers, databases, and security measures. By the end of this project, you should be able to design and describe web infrastructures for different use cases and understand the principles behind their architecture.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of web infrastructure.
- Identify the different components of a web infrastructure and their roles.
- Design simple and complex web infrastructures.
- Explain the advantages and limitations of different web infrastructure designs.
- Implement security measures to protect web infrastructures.
- Understand scalability, redundancy, and fault tolerance in web infrastructure.

## Project Files

- **0-simple_web_stack**: Diagram and description of a simple web infrastructure that hosts a website using a single server.
- **1-distributed_web_infrastructure**: Diagram and description of a distributed web infrastructure using multiple servers.
- **2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure**: Diagram and description of a web infrastructure that includes security measures and monitoring.
- **3-scale_up**: Diagram and description of a web infrastructure designed to scale up, including load balancing and database replication.

## How to Use

To understand and utilize the concepts in this project, follow these steps:

1. Review the diagrams provided for each web infrastructure design.
2. Read the accompanying descriptions to understand the components and their roles.
3. Analyze the advantages and limitations of each design.
4. Apply the principles learned to design your own web infrastructures for different scenarios.

### Examples

Here are some examples of web infrastructure designs covered in this project:

- **Simple Web Stack**:
  - A single server hosts a web application and a database.
  - Ideal for low-traffic websites or development environments.

- **Distributed Web Infrastructure**:
  - Multiple servers host the web application, with a load balancer distributing traffic.
  - Provides better performance and reliability for higher-traffic websites.

- **Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure**:
  - Includes firewalls, SSL certificates, and monitoring tools.
  - Ensures the security and availability of the web application.

- **Scale Up Infrastructure**:
  - Uses load balancing and database replication to handle increased traffic.
  - Ensures scalability and fault tolerance for growing web applications.
