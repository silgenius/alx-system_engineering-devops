# 0x17. Web Stack Debugging #3

## Description

This project is part of the Web Stack Debugging series, which aims to improve your skills in debugging complex web systems. In this project, you'll be given a scenario where a web server is not functioning as expected, and your task is to identify and fix the issue. The debugging process requires a deep understanding of how web servers, databases, and other components of a web stack interact with each other.
